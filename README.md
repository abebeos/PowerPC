# Barrier-Free PowerPC OSS-Development.

## What are we doing here?

* We process several PowerPC OSS related development tasks.
* We identify barriers and file them as issues.
* We process those issues in order to eliminate the barriers.
    * => Thus no developer needs to overcome them in future

## Why?

This results in a more barrier-free PowerPC OSS Development, which makes it more accessible to interested newcomers.

* Interested Newcomers can easier join
* Experts are not alienated by barriers-to-entry.

## Prerequisites

* Win/Lin/Mac Machine
* Docker, git, VSCode
* Usual Package-Manager (chocolateley, apt, etc.)
