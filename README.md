## Tasks

(draft)

* Provide a near-zero-efffort ppc64le dev-system setup
    * => Enable more developers to focus on issues at hand (instead of setup)
    * => Enable developers without ppc hardware to work on ppc isssues
* Specify a generic porting-process
    * draft: clarity, decoupling
* JITLink Implementation
    * Refactor relevant RtDyld code (strict, for clarity only)
    * Split down further tasks (e.g. JITLink implementation) into manageable chunks
    * Assess overall effort
    * Provide info-streams re llvm/numba ppc development
        * => easily subscribe to ppc-related issues and commits
